### 12Ã¨me jour de la Lune Froide

Good? Evil? Lies. I've seen what people who call themselves good are capable of in the name of goodness, in the name of the triumph of the light over all things dark. But such is not the way of life. The Gods blessed upon us multiplicity, along with tenderness and solidarity come cruelty and ignorance. Only the fools believe in good and evil, and believe the mouth of men for speaking truth when they barely know what they are made of. Evil lurks where goodness abounds, and goodness tints all evil that exists. Nothing is ever what it is in the eyes of another beholder. One's happiness is one's sorrow, and I am tired. I've seen too much blood. Too much by my own hands. I want to rest and atone, and finally find the love I was longing for all this time, the community I never got. I was a fool too, once, and believed good things came to those who worked hard. It's not true. Working hard will transform you into an unrecognizable version of yourself, at best. One day you wake up and wonder what the point of it all was, why I did what I did and earned nothing that life holds invaluable and mysterious. Nothing but a bloody reputation and a name whispered and feared amidst the desert. A blade in the shadow, Teloyah Shadowblade was my name. Who am I? What's my name? Is it they who carve the subtleties of my being as I strive to be strong, only to be met by contempt and coins, tears of salt and blood? Who am I? Am I making sense at all or is everything becoming a blur because of the heaviness of the desert that was once so promising? Solitude at its peak feels a lot like death. This feeling of roaming lifelessly, aimlessly, lovelessly, constantly reminding you no one will miss you when you're gone.
