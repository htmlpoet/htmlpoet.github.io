## Chapter 2

The story for the first arc begins here. You can write in Markdown, which is very simple.

Use headings for chapters, **bold** for emphasis, and *italics* for thoughts.

A new paragraph is just created by leaving an empty line. It's much cleaner for writing fiction than using `<p>` tags everywhere.
